# banking-system-Scheme
Banking System Designed in Scheme
Few Functions are working: 
1. Deposit (Stores additional ammount in an already defined ammount ("dep-status"))
2. Withdraw (Decrements the ammount of cash stored in the defined ammount)
3. Check Status (Displays the current balance in KM's)

Note: This was me playing around a little with Scheme, this is just me warming up for my final exam. :)
